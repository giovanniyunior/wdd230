        <p>Cartagena, known since the colonial era as Cartagena de Indias,  is a city and one of the major ports on the northern coast of Colombia in the Caribbean Coast Region, bordering the Caribbean sea.</p>
        <img data-src="images/discover/2.jpg" class="rocorn" src="images/lazyload/placeholder-300x400.png" alt="PlaceHolder IMG 2">
        <p>Cartagena is located to the north of Colombia, at 10°25'N 75°32'W. It faces the Caribbean Sea to the west. To the south is the Cartagena Bay, which has two entrances: Bocachica (Small Mouth) in the south, and Bocagrande (Big Mouth) in the north. Its coastal line is characterized morphologically by dissipative beaches.</p>

        <p>Cartagena's old city is its principal attraction, particularly the inner walled town, consisting of the historical districts of El Centro and San Diego.</p>
        <img data-src="images/discover/5.jpg" class="rocorn" src="images/lazyload/placeholder-300x400.png" alt="PlaceHolder IMG 5">
        <p>The best way to experience the Old Town is to wander in leisurely fashion, savoring the architectural details, street life and local snacks along the way. Nighttime adds a whole different dimension.</p>

        <p>It's one of finest examples of preserved colonial architecture in the Americas, packed with churches, monasteries, plazas, palaces and mansions with their famous overhanging balconies and shady patios.</p>
